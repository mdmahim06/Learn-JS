# Data Types

Here’s the updated list with `NaN` included:

### **Data Types in JavaScript**

#### **Number**

- **Description**: Represents numerical values, including both integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Range**: Can store values from `-(2^53 - 1)` to `2^53 - 1` with precision.
- **Use Cases**: Arithmetic operations, mathematical functions, and numeric calculations.
- **Special Considerations**: For very large integers or precise calculations beyond this range, consider using `BigInt` or handle floating-point precision issues with `Number.EPSILON`.

#### **BigInt**

- **Description**: A data type introduced in ES2020 for representing arbitrarily large integers.
- **Range**: Can store integers beyond the limits of the `Number` type.
- **Use Cases**: When exact calculations with very large integers are needed, such as in cryptography or high-precision computations.
- **Creation**: Use the `n` suffix to create `BigInt` values (e.g., `123n`).

#### **String**

- **Description**: Represents sequences of characters, which can include text, symbols, and numbers.
- **Syntax**: Enclosed in single quotes (`'Hello'`) or double quotes (`"world"`).
- **Use Cases**: Handling and manipulating textual data, user input, and string-based operations.
- **Methods**: Common methods include `length`, `indexOf`, `slice`, and `concat`.

#### **Boolean**

- **Description**: Represents logical values, either `true` or `false`.
- **Use Cases**: Control flow in conditional statements, logical operations (AND, OR, NOT), and decisions in programming.

#### **null**

- **Description**: A special value indicating the deliberate absence of any object value.
- **Use Cases**: To represent an intentionally empty or non-existent value for a variable or property.

#### **undefined**

- **Description**: A special value indicating that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
- **Use Cases**: To check if a variable has been initialized; it is different from `null` which is used for explicit absence of value.

#### **Symbol**

- **Description**: A unique and immutable data type used for object properties that need to be unique or private.
- **Creation**: Created using the `Symbol()` function.
- **Use Cases**: Defining unique property keys that won’t clash with any other property keys.

#### **NaN**

- **Description**: Stands for "Not a Number" and represents a value that is not a legal number, usually the result of invalid arithmetic operations.
- **Type**: `NaN` is of type `number`.
- **Use Cases**: Indicates an error or an undefined numerical result in calculations.
- **Special Considerations**: `NaN` is not equal to any value, including itself. Use `isNaN()` to check if a value is `NaN`.

  ```javascript
  console.log(NaN === NaN); // false
  console.log(isNaN(NaN)); // true
  ```
