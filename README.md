# JavaScript Conversion Operations

In JavaScript, conversion operations allow you to transform data from one type to another. This document covers the most common type conversions: string, number, and boolean conversions, as well as explicit and implicit conversions.

## Introduction

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means variables are not directly associated with any specific data type. Often, you may need to convert data between different types for operations such as user inputs, calculations, or conditional checks.

## Types of Conversions

### 1. String Conversion

String conversion occurs when a value is converted to a string. You can explicitly convert a value to a string using `String()` or implicitly through concatenation with a string.

#### Explicit Conversion:
```javascript
let num = 123;
let str = String(num);
console.log(str); // "123"
